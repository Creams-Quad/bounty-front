# Conflict Plan
When conflict arises, we will first and foremost communicate and gather a solution. If conflict escalates we will reach out toa third party member such as a TA or the instructor to mitigate our conflict and come to a uniform solution. 

Each team member will contribute and contributions made by each team member will come from constant communication and a check-up to see what has been done. If any team member finds that there is no work to be done, we will discuss what needs to be done and the team member will contribute to work that can be done. 

Each team member will come to a uniform understanding in a technical and and skill level standpoint through constant communication and sharing references to documentation. In the event that there is no understanding of all team members, that is the time to reach out to a third party such as a TA or an instructor for clarification. We will give ourselves a 15-30 min time-frame to figure a solution without third party intervention. 

For team members not adequately contributing, communication is the first step in determining if this team member is currently struggling with something, before assigning a role to that team member. 

**Unsuccessful conflict resolution will result with a third party intervention from a TA or an instructor to find the adequate solution** 

# Communication Plan 

Hours of operational communication will be from 9AM to 5PM, via Slack messaging, Zoom break-out rooms, or a table in Remo. If a team member is working after or before hours, communication will be done through Slack messaging and then CAN escalate into a video conference. 

Breaks will be performed at the top of each hour and general lunch time will be at 12PM and is flexible dependant on work load. 

A strategy to include everyone will be with constant communication and a review from each team member. All voices will be heard and an agreement from all team members must be done in order to progress.

This is a safe environment, so if there is anything that will potentially offend, we will ensure that each topic that is discussed is done so in a professional manner. Discrimination is not tolerated. 

# Git Process

To be able to merge onto the main branch of a repository, 1 team member MUST approve the code. There will be a merge branch before it is merged onto the main branch where it will be merged at the 5PM meeting after code review and discussion.
